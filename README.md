**"The Leverage Connection in an Emerging Economy: Impact of Board Gender Diversity and Financial Structure on Firm Performance"**

## 🧠 Abstract

This study investigates the impact of board gender diversity on the financial performance of 231 NSE-listed firms in India over the period 2015–2024. Using robust econometric techniques such as Fixed Effects, System GMM, and Quantile-on-Quantile Regression, we explore how gender representation on corporate boards and executive leadership affects Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Our findings reveal that:

- Gender diversity significantly improves firm performance, especially among top and bottom performers.
- Board-level representation has a stronger influence than executive-level diversity.
- The effects are moderated by firm financial structure and align with UN SDGs 5, 8, and 16.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: NSE 500 index firms (Bloomberg database)
- **Period**: 2015–2024
- **Observations**: 2,310 firm-year entries
- **Key Variables**: ROA, ROE, Women on Board, Women Executives, Market Capitalization, Leverage, etc.

> Note: Data will be made available upon request.

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Panel Data Regression** (FE/RE)
- **System GMM Estimation** (to address endogeneity)
- **Quantile-on-Quantile Regression** (for heterogeneous impact analysis)

## 📌 Key Results

| Metric | Impact of Women on Board |
|--------|---------------------------|
| ROA (Bottom 10%) | ↑ 0.425 |
| ROA (Top 90%)    | ↑ 0.933 |
| ROE (Top 90%)    | ↑ 2.820 |

- **Women Executives** had positive but less significant effects.
- **Leverage** negatively moderated the diversity-performance link in highly leveraged firms.

## 🎯 Policy & Strategic Implications

- Firms should **go beyond minimal compliance** and aim for **20–30% female board representation**.
- Diversity should be integrated as a **strategic asset**, especially for high-performing and well-governed firms.
- Policymakers can strengthen gender mandates and support capacity building for meaningful inclusion.

## 🌍 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Alignment
